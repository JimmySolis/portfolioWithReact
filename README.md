  ### How it Works:

  #### 1) React automatically bundles my code. Therefore, this layout has all the files and folders that make up my app.   
  ![Layout](./public/img/Layout.png)

  #### 2) In the public folder I store all my images that I use throughout the app. As well as my resume pdf.
  ![ImgFolder](./public/img/imgFolder.png)

  #### 3) In these files I have the rendering of JSX that is inputed as a div with the id = root. All my dependency are impoted here as well giving me the chance to utilize throughout my app.

  #### 4) Here are the core componets that work as sectionals for my app.

  #### 5) Finally here I have the actual content that goes in each page. Sectioning out like this help alot. Making the app very quick.
