Who is Jimmy Solis? Well this quick passage will update you to his current state:
Right as the pandemic started, everything I was working on came to an abrupt stop.
For three years I was submerged in an art school trying to get into a BFA program.
Right as I was accepted, I had to get out.
My family was struggling to make ends meet and living in Los Angeles forced us to act fast and relocate to Florida.
Here, I got a job as a bartender and went to work every single day for the next two years.
I learned a lot about the world as it is today and promised myself to excel in everything I do to ensure my family never has to fear for a secure living.
With that mindset, I seeked an opportunity to grow as an individual and I stumbled upon computer coding.
I simply wanted to upload my drawings to a website of my own which lead me to discover the art of web design.
From there, I was hooked. I'm able to channel my creativity and provide a suitable living for my family.
I’m grateful for how things turned out and I'm the happiest I’ve ever been.</p>
